Overview
“Daily Competitive Programming” is a Desktop Application developed in Java Programming 
Language. Often Beginners in competitive programming face some problems to find their strategy 
to improve. Keeping track of our daily activity on competitive programming is the most important 
thing in this sector. So, I have come up with a plan to develop such a tracker with my present 
knowledge. It is a mini application with some tracking features.
Goals
1. Track Problem Solving: It is designed specially for competitive programmers who want
to keep track of their daily problem solving and coding activities.
2. Track Learning Progress: Anyone can keep the daily learning activity on a track so 
that he/she will be able to see the progress done so far.
3. Feedback on Progress: Users of the application will get timely feedback on their 
progress to not lose hope on Competitive Programming.
